(&ldquo;Peasisoft&rdquo;, &ldquo;we&rdquo;, &ldquo;us&rdquo; and/or &ldquo;our&rdquo;) and has been created to provide our Site visitors (&ldquo;you&rdquo;, &ldquo;your&rdquo;) with information about our company and our e-mail collection tools. This Privacy Policy (this &ldquo;Policy&rdquo;) sets forth Peasisoft&rsquo;s policy with respect to information, including personally identifiable data (such personally identifiable data &ldquo;Personal Information&rdquo;), that is collected from you through the Site or through our other service offerings (collectively, including the Site, the &ldquo;Services&rdquo;). Certain Services may be made available to you on websites owned by our end customers (each, an &ldquo;End Customers&rdquo;), and the information collected via these embedded widgets (&ldquo;Tools&rdquo;) is directed to Peasisoft and governed by this Policy.</p>

          <p class="mt-4">The Services and our business may change from time to time. As a result, at times it may be necessary for Peasisoft to make changes to this Policy. Peasisoft reserves the right to update this Policy at any time and from time to time without prior notice. Please review this Policy periodically, and especially before you provide any Personal Information. This Policy was last updated on the date indicated above. Your continued use of the Services after any changes or revisions to this Policy shall indicate your agreement with the terms of such revised Policy.</p>

          <p class="mt-4">1. Information Collected</p>

          <p class="mt-4">When you interact with us through the Site or other Services, we may collect Personal Information and other information from you, as further described below:</p>

          <p class="mt-4">Personal Information That You Provide</p>

          <p class="mt-4">We collect Personal Information from you when you voluntarily provide such information, such as when you contact us with inquiries, subscribe to our or a Peasisoft End Customer&rsquo;s e-mail newsletter, register for access to the Services or use certain Services. For instance, Peasisoft may collect the following information about you: name, address, zip code, telephone number and e-mail address. The information collected may vary. For example, our End Customers may customize the data that is requested via the Tools and may collect other information, such as your favorite color or birthdate. Wherever Peasisoft collects Personal Information we make an effort to provide a link to this Policy.</p>

          <p class="mt-4">By voluntarily providing us with Personal Information, you are consenting to our use of it in accordance with this Policy. If you provide Personal Information to the Site or through the other Services, you acknowledge, agree, and expressly consent that such Personal Information may be transferred from your current location to the offices and servers of Peasisoft and the authorized third parties referred to herein located in the United States.</p>

          <p class="mt-4">Other Information</p>

          <p class="mt-4">Non-Identifiable Data: When you interact with Peasisoft through the Services, we receive and store certain personally non-identifiable information. Such information, which is collected passively using various technologies, cannot presently be used to specifically identify you, unless it is combined with Personal Information. Peasisoft may store such information itself or such information may be included in databases owned and maintained by Peasisoft affiliates, agents or service providers. We may use such information and pool it with other information to track, for example, the total number of visitors to our Site, the number of visitors to each page of our Site, and the domain names of our visitors' Internet service providers. It is important to note that Peasisoft uses no Personal Information in this process.</p>

We may, or a third party may, place and recognize a unique cookie on your browser specifically to identify you for the purposes of providing you with customized ads or content across channels. The cookies may be linked to data you voluntarily submit to us, e.g., your email address, which we may share with a third party. If we share such Personal Information it will be in hashed, non-human readable form for security purposes only.
